This repository contains the code for an Allergic Food Project, focusing on predicting and managing allergic reactions related to certain foods. The system utilizes machine learning, specifically implementing [Specify the algorithm or approach], and takes into account various features such as the individual's allergies, dietary preferences, and location. The implementation includes a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions, enhancing accessibility and usability for potential users.

## Why ONEAPI
![openai](https://github.com/Nandhiha/Alergic-Food-Model/assets/116743485/78e06ba5-8caa-4e46-b2b2-4c86b996fbda)

The grand idea behind oneAPI is to enable the use of one platform for a range of different hardware, hence developers would not have to use different languages, tools, and libraries when they code for CPUs and GPUs.

## Model Comparison

We evaluated Six machine learning models:

1.Naive Bayes Accuracy: 0.95

2.Decision Tree Accuracy: 0.95

3.Random Forest Accuracy: 0.95

4.SVM Accuracy: 0.95

5.KNN Accuracy: 0.95

6.Logical regression Accuracy: 85 

Accuracies of different models are actually similar so we chose naive bayes because it gives output in less time.
